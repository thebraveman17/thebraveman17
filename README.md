## About me

I am Uroš Ognjenović, a **Solidity** developer and **Web3** enthusiast.

With a solid foundation in Solidity and a passion for Web3 and blockchain technology, I am on a mission to contribute to the decentralized future. Over the past year, I have dedicated myself to mastering Solidity, building smart contracts, and understanding the nuances of blockchain development. My journey in the Web3 space began three years ago, and since then, I have been deeply involved in exploring the transformative potential of decentralized technologies.

## Tools and technologies:

- **Foundry**: Proficient with **Forge**, **Cast**, **Anvil**, and **Chisel** for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Skilled in writing comprehensive tests, including unit, integration, fuzz (stateless and stateful), invariant, and differential tests, to ensure the robustness and security of smart contracts.
- **Remix**: Experienced in using **Remix** IDE for writing, testing, and debugging Solidity code.
- **Node as a Service**: Utilized **Alchemy**'s and **Infura**'s powerful infrastructure to interact with Ethereum and other blockchain networks.
- **Etherscan**: Skilled in using Etherscan for verifying contracts and tracking transactions.
- **Python**: Proficient in using **web3** and **eth_account** libraries for tasks such as signing and sending transactions with local private keys, interacting with smart contracts, and reading data from the blockchain.
- **JavaScript**: Proficient in **TypeScript** for robust type-checking and maintainable code, **React** for building responsive, user-friendly interfaces, **wagmi** for streamlined Web3 integration and wallet management, and **viem** for efficient interaction with smart contracts and blockchain data.
- **Git**: Experienced in using Git for version control, including branching, merging, and collaborating on code with distributed teams. Comfortable with managing repositories, handling pull requests, and maintaining a clean commit history.

## My key interests include:

- Developing secure and efficient smart contracts.
- Exploring innovative use cases for blockchain in various industries.
- Contributing to open-source blockchain projects.
- Staying updated with the latest trends and advancements in the Web3 ecosystem.

I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills to work on cutting-edge projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals who share a vision for a decentralized and transparent world. Let's connect and explore opportunities to innovate and drive the blockchain revolution forward.
